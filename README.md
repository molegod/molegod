# Hi there, I'm Peter! 👋

**Cornell University 🌽 ECE + CS Minor '27**

I am engineering student and researcher working at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Wearables**, and **XR**. 

Most of my projects can be found on my website at [peterhe.dev](https://peterhe.dev). I've worked on many different things ranging from **[gaussian splat localization](https://peterhe.dev/gaussian-splat)** to **[consumer flamethrowers](https://peterhe.dev/firebender)** to weird attempts at **[being spiderman through electrostimulation](https://peterhe.dev/sixthsense)**. 

I also have co-authored 2 **[research papers](https://peterhe.dev/research)** at CHI/UIST.
